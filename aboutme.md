Hi there! As you probably already know my name is Mina, and I've been learning and growing in my new career as a Cloud Engineer. 

Some of the areas I've worked in are:

- AWS
- GCP
- Cybersecurity
- Terraform
- Python, HTML, YAML, and other languages

### My journey

I spent most of my life hating technology, what I always say is I was never even able to hook up a printer! In 2023 however I decided I wanted to build something and find a career that I could actually enjoy, something that would challenge me but also allow me to exercise some of my creativity. Somehow and someway I landed on DevOps, going from zero tech knowledge to now being able to showcase my cloud based projets has been a whirlwind, but an exciting one! 

If you'd like to learn all about my experience in more detail then check out my [blog](https://external.ink?to=/dev.to/minab/from-barista-to-cloud-engineer-2eki).
